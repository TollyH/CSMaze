SELECT|Empty Space: There's nothing here. How boring. Appears on both the normal map and cheat map.
WALL|Wall: Blocks the player from moving through. Each of the four sides can have its own texture. Click/drag on multiple walls to bulk update textures, or press 'A' to select them all. Appears on both the normal map and cheat map.
START|Start Point: Where the player will be placed when the level starts and upon resetting. The player will always be facing south when spawned. Appears on both the normal map and cheat map.
END|End/Exit Point: The point the player must reach to complete the level after collecting all the keys. Appears on only the cheat map.
KEY|Key: Levels can have as many of these as you see fit, and can even be left out entirely. The player must collect every key before being allowed to exit the level. Appears on only the cheat map unless the player has a key sensor.
SENSOR|Key Sensor: When picked up by the player, will show all remaining keys on the map for a short period. Appears on only the cheat map.
GUN|Gun: A gun with a single bullet. Can be fired by the player at will after being picked up, and, if the monster is hit, will cause it to be sent back to its spawn point. Appears on only the cheat map.
MONSTER|Monster Spawn: Where the monster will appear after the given delay has elapsed. This is optional and can be left out to have no monster in the level. The monster will never spawn while the player is within two map units of this point. Appears on both the normal map and cheat map.
DECORATION|Decoration: A sprite whose texture can be customised. Does not block the player and has no effect on gameplay. Does not appear on either the normal map or the cheat map.
