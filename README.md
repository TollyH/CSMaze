# CSMaze

A pseudo-3D, grid-based maze game written in C# with SDL2. Written as a more performant version of the pure Python [PyMaze](https://github.com/TollyH/pymaze).

This version of the game is identical in almost every way to the original. The rendering and physics are all done by an original engine operating in the same way to the Python version's. For gameplay controls and instructions, please see the README for the [PyMaze repository](https://github.com/TollyH/pymaze).
